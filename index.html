                    Archaeology studies the past through material remains and artefacts, helping us understand how
                    ancient societies lived, worked, and interacted with their environment. Without systematic research,
                    much of human history would remain unknown.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The science of archaeology is vital for understanding the deep past of human civilization. Serbia,
                    positioned at the crossroads of Central Europe and the Balkans, has a long and complex history
                    shaped by diverse cultures, landscapes, and historical processes. This rich past has produced
                    thousands of archaeological sites, many officially protected as cultural heritage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this site, we will learn more about archaeology and history by exploring selected examples of
                    archaeological sites from Serbia and understanding what they reveal about past human life.

            <aside class="extra">
                <h4>How it all began?</h4>
                <p>
                    Archaeology started as curiosity about ancient traces and the lives of people long ago. In the 18th
                    and early 19th centuries, scholars in Europe and the Mediterranean began exploring ruins and
                    recording sites, treating the past as something that could be studied scientifically rather than
                    imagined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the discipline grew, archaeology spread across continents, turning scattered
                    discoveries into a vast story of human history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Serbia, the discipline formally started in 1881, when Mihailo Valtrović became the first
                    archaeology professor at the Grande école (later University of Belgrade), and the first systematic
                    excavations began in 1882 at the Roman site of Viminacium. Major 20th-century sites like Lepenski
                    Vir and Vinča later highlighted Serbia's importance for early European prehistory.

                    Archaeology studies material traces left by past communities to understand their social life,
                    technology, economy, and beliefs. Key areas include:
                </p>

                <ul class="study-list">
                    <li><strong>Settlement remains</strong>: houses, villages, and other sites showing how communities
                        lived and organized space.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tombs, human and animal remains</strong>: burial sites revealing social hierarchy,
                        rituals, and beliefs about
                        death, and skeletal material providing insights into
                        health, diet, demographics,
                        domestication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Everyday objects and artefacts</strong>: tools, pottery, clothing, jewelry, and symbolic
                        items reflecting daily life and craft.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infrastructure and trade</strong>: roads, bridges, aqueducts,
                        urban planning, illustrating communication, trade, technology or cultural exchange.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forts and defensive structures</strong>: fortifications, walls, watchtowers, and other
                        military
                        installations
                        indicating strategies for protection of territory, and settlement planning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Religious architecture and objects, art and symbolic expression</strong>: temples,
                        shrines, ritual tools,
                        and religious constructions
                        reflecting spiritual and ceremonial practices.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By combining these findings, archaeologists gain insight into how communities adapted to their
                    surroundings, developed technologies, organized socially, and interacted with neighboring cultures
                    over time.</p>

            <aside class="extra">
                <h4>Did you know?</h4>
                <p>During the Ice Ages, harsh climatic conditions made human settlements in Europe rare and widely
                    dispersed. Only in certain favorable regions could small groups survive and leave archaeological
                    traces.</p>
                <p>The main reasons for these glacial periods are celestial in nature, as first proposed by Milutin
                    Milanković, Serbian mathematician. <br> He identified three key astronomical cycles that influence
                    Earth's climate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Precession:</strong> the wobble in Earth's rotation axis, which affects the timing of
                        seasons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Obliquity (axial tilt):</strong> changes in the angle of Earth's axis, altering seasons
                        intensity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Eccentricity:</strong> the shape of Earth's orbit around the Sun, affecting solar
                        radiation received.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/IvyTerra/archaeology-site@main/images/precessing_Kepler_orbit_280frames_e0.6_smaller.gif"

                <p class="image-caption">The eccentricity of the orbital ellipse</p>

                <p>These cycles, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles"
                        target="_blank">Milankovitch cycles</a>, interact over tens of thousands of years to produce
                    long
                    glacial and interglacial periods. Evidence from ice cores supports their influence, though other
                    climatic factors also contribute to a complete understanding.</p>

                    Archaeological research combines practical fieldwork with analytical methods. These activities help
                    uncover, document, and interpret material traces, allowing archaeologists to reconstruct past
                    environments, cultural practices, and historical developments.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Survey methods</strong>: before excavation, archaeologists use techniques like
                        magnetometry, ground-penetrating radar, electrical resistivity, soil analyses, pedestrian
                        surveys, aerial photography, satellite imagery, and LiDAR to detect buried structures and map
                        promising areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Field excavations</strong>: excavations follow
                        rigorous methods. Each trench or test pit is numbered and recorded in a diary, noting soil
                        layers, features, artefacts, and conditions. Measurements are taken with surveying instruments,
                        and structures and artefacts are photographed, drawn, and labeled for laboratory analysis.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Artefact analysis</strong>: every object tells a tale. From pottery shards to metal
                        tools, archaeologists examine artefacts to determine their function, origin, and cultural
                        significance. Techniques such as microscopic analysis, residue testing, and 3D scanning help
                        reconstruct ancient diets, technologies, and artistic expression.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dating and contextualization</strong>: archaeologists use stratigraphy,
                        dendrochronology, radiocarbon analysis, and other methods to date finds and place them in
                        historical and cultural contexts. This builds timelines showing settlement, migration, and
                        interaction patterns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Publishing results</strong>: research only becomes meaningful when shared through
                        reports, articles, conferences, museum exhibits, and digital reconstructions, connecting the
                        past with modern society and advancing knowledge.</li>

                    The history of human existence is traditionally divided into distinct periods.
                    For the largest part of this history, our knowledge is limited, and it belongs to what is called
                    Prehistory.
                    Prehistory itself is divided into the Stone Age - Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, and
                    the
                    Metal Age - Copper, Bronze, and Iron.
                    Recorded history begins with the emergence of writing. <br>
                    Antiquity is a diverse period, marked by achievements in science, architecture, and social
                    organization. <br>
                    It is followed by the Middle Ages, which also witnessed major civilizational developments,
                    culminating with the Renaissance, the invention of the printing press, and the Age of Discovery,
                    heralding a new era.

                <h4>Stratigraphy</h4>
                <p>
                    Stratigraphy studies the soil layers at an archaeological site. Upper layers are younger, while
                    lower layers are older. This sequence helps archaeologists establish the relative chronology of a
                    site and understand how settlements developed over time.

                    Lepenski Vir is a uniquely organized Mesolithic settlement located in the Đerdap (Iron Gates) Gorge,
                    occupied roughly between 9500 and 6000 BCE, and known for its trapezoidal houses with red limestone
                    floors and carefully planned layout. It is also famous for its monumental fish-human stone
                    sculptures, while the site as a whole reflects a broader transition from hunter-gatherer life toward
                    early Neolithic practices.</p>
                <p>In its later phase, Lepenski Vir III (Starčevo phase) demonstrates a clear transition to the
                    Neolithic period, through the interaction of local hunter-gatherers and incoming farmers from the
                    Aegean/Anatolia. This change is evident in the introduction of Starčevo pottery and new tools, as
                    well as changes in diet to include domesticated animals and plants. Ritual practices also evolved,
                    combining the local tradition of trapezoidal houses with Neolithic customs such as building clay
                    ovens and burials within the settlement, pointing to a hybrid culture. About chronology and

                    The Vinča culture represents one of the most significant and earliest large-scale prehistoric
                    settlements in Europe. The type site, Vinča-Belo Brdo, was discovered in 1908 by the prominent
                    Serbian archaeologist Miloje Vasić. This crucial archaeological site is located approximately 14
                    kilometers southeast of Belgrade, Serbia, positioned on the right bank of the Danube river.
                    <br>The broader Vinča culture itself was the dominant Neolithic culture in Southeastern Europe,
                    centered in modern-day Serbia, with influence and settlements extending across the territories
                    of several contemporary nations, including Romania (Transylvania and Oltenia), Bulgaria, Bosnia
                    and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Croatia, and Hungary.<br>
                </p>
                <p>The culture thrived from approximately 5400 to 4500 BCE and is known for its well-planned
                    settlements, substantial multi-room houses, and complex social organization, forming Europe's
                    first proto-urban communities. The rich material culture is highlighted by thousands of
                    intricate clay figurines, which suggest elaborate ritual practices and a complex symbolic
                    system. <br>While graves within the settlements are rare, separate, organized necropolises
                    indicate structured funerary rites. Settlements sometimes featured defensive structures like
                    palisades and ditches, and the deliberate burning of old houses created the characteristic
                    archaeological mounds known as "tells".</p>

                <p>The Vinča culture provides the world's earliest known examples of copper smelting at sites like
                    Pločnik and Belovode. This evidence of early metalworking marks the beginning of the
                    Chalcolithic (Copper Age) within the Neolithic context, showcasing an advanced technological
                    capability that predates other metal ages globally.

                    <a href="https://ai.ac.rs/en/7729/" target="_blank">Sirmium</a> was an important Roman city located
                    in today's Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia. Founded in the 1st
                    century AD, it soon became one of the four capitals of the Roman Empire during the Tetrarchy. As a
                    major administrative and military center of Roman province Pannonia, Sirmium played a crucial role
                    in controlling
                    the Danube frontier and trade routes across the Balkans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city is known as the birthplace (or seat of power) of several Roman emperors, including Probus,
                    Maximian, Constantius II, Gratian, and others who spent significant time in the imperial palace. In
                    the Late Antiquity, Sirmium developed a strong Christian tradition, with an early bishopric and the
                    growing veneration of Saint Demetrius, after whom the city was later named.
                </p>
                <p>Archaeological excavations have revealed impressive remains of the imperial palace, granaries, baths,
                    villas, and a large hippodrome. One of the most remarkable discoveries is over 350m² of preserved
                    floor mosaics, highlighting the city's wealth and refined artistic culture.

                <h4>Did you know?</h4>
                <p>The modern-day country of Serbia holds a unique place in world history as the birthplace of 18 Roman
                    Emperors, more than any other single province outside of Italy itself. This concentration of
                    imperial power stemmed from the region's status as the vital military frontier (the Illyricum
                    provinces), which produced capable generals during the tumultuous third and fourth centuries. <br>
                    Among key Roman Emperors that fundamentally shaped Western civilization are: <br>
                    Aurelian, born near Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica), militarily reunited the empire during the chaotic
                    3rd century, <br>
                    Constantine the Great, born in Niš (Naissus), legalized Christianity and founded Constantinople,
                    shifting the empire's religious and political center eastward, <br>
                    Justinian I, born near Caričin Grad (Justiniana Prima), consolidated Roman law into the Corpus Juris
                    Civilis, the foundation of modern law, and launched the final attempt to restore full Roman
                    Mediterranean control.

                    Viminacium was a major Roman legionary fortress and city located near modern Požarevac, Serbia, on
                    the territory of the ancient Roman province of Moesia. Established in the 1st century AD, it
                    remained an important military, administrative, and commercial center until the 6th century.</p>
                <p>Excavations have revealed a well-planned city with streets, public buildings, baths, an amphitheater,
                    and a necropolis. Rich tombs, mosaics, and frescoes provide detailed insight into everyday life,
                    social organization, and artistic traditions of the Roman period.</p>
                <p>Viminacium also served as a
                    strategic military camp for Roman legions, controlling traffic along the Danube frontier. Beneath
                    the
                    Roman layers, archaeologists have uncovered prehistoric deposits, including remains of mammoths,
                    showing
                    that the site was occupied long before the Roman period. Thousands of artefacts, including weapons,
                    jewelry, and ceramics, highlight the city's cultural and economic significance in the Roman Balkans.

                <p>Roman baths were complex public buildings used for hygiene, socializing, and relaxation. They
                    typically included a series of rooms: the frigidarium (cold room), tepidarium (warm room), and
                    caldarium (hot room), all heated by a hypocaust system, an underfloor structure that circulated warm
                    air. Floors were raised on pillars to allow hot air to pass, and walls and floors were built with
                    waterproof materials to retain heat and water. These baths demonstrate the advanced engineering and
                    architectural skills of the Romans.</p>

                    Adriatic coast. This blend of Western Romanesque forms and Byzantine tradition is characteristic of
                    the Raška style and places Studenica within broader European artistic trends of the late 12th

                    1951. and 1958., with later supplementary investigations in the 1960s-1970s and smaller targeted

            <h4>Nomocanon</h4>
            <p>Studenica Monastery was the operational base where Saint Sava organized the independent Serbian church
                and administration. In 1219, he compiled the legal code under the name of Zakonopravilo (known as Saint
                Sava's Nomocanon or Krmčija - Pilot's Book).
            </p>
            <p>
                This work integrated both church rules (canon law) and secular regulations (civil law) from Byzantine
                sources, adapting them for the Serbian state. It introduced detailed provisions that regulated property
                damages and provided specific legal protection for the most vulnerable members of society, including
                women and children.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Nomocanon became the foundational legal document for medieval Serbia. It directly provided the legal
                principles and structure upon which Dušan's Code (Dušanov Zakonik, the most famous secular Serbian law
                code from 1349.) was built. The Nomocanon essentially established the rule of law in medieval Serbia.

            <p>The Miroslav Gospel (Miroslavljevo jevanđelje), dating from around 1180-1190., is the oldest surviving
                illuminated manuscript written in the Serbian Cyrillic script (the Gospel can be downloaded from <a

                The 362-page parchment manuscript is celebrated for its mix of Western European and Byzantine art,
                featuring nearly 300 ornate initials and miniatures. After a turbulent history and centuries at the

                    Resava Monastery is a Serbian Orthodox monastery near Despotovac, Serbia, founded by Despot Stefan
                    Lazarević between 1406. and 1418. The monastery is dedicated to the Holy Trinity, while the main
                    church is dedicated to St. George.
                </p>
                <p>The complex includes fortification walls with eleven towers, including a central donžon (keep) tower,
                    a gate, and other defensive elements, highlighting its strategic importance. Its architectural style
                    belongs to the Morava School, known for decorative stonework and balanced proportions.</p>
                <p>The monastery became an important center of literacy and manuscript production. The Resava School,
                    founded by Konstantin the Philosopher, served as a scriptorium and literary workshop. Its main goal
                    was to correct errors in earlier translations and copies, establishing a consistent and highly
                    valued orthographic standard. The school was extremely productive: its influence persisted
                    throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, with its reputation lasting until the end of the 17th
                    century. The monastery possessed a library of over 20,000 books (volumes). The impact of Resava's
                    orthographic rules and manuscript work extended to other monasteries across the Balkans (Hilandar,
                    Peć Patriarchate, Dečani, Ljubostinja) and even reached Russia, Bulgaria, and Romania.</p>
                <p>Under Despot Stefan Lazarević, Resava played a central role in the cultural, educational, and
                    defensive life of medieval Serbia, influencing other monasteries, manuscript production, and
                    Morava-style architecture in the region.</p>
                <p>Archaeological research and restoration at Resava Monastery, mainly between the 1950s and 1970s,
                    focused on the church structure, fortification walls, frescoes, and monastic buildings, with further
                    conservation and targeted studies continuing into the 21st century. During these works, foundations,
                    architectural details, and traces of earlier construction phases were documented, providing insight
                    into the original layout and the development of the complex over time.</p>

            <h4 id="belgrade">Belgrade: A Capital 7,000 Years in the Making</h4>
            <p>The choice of Belgrade as the capital was not merely sentimental but also extremely pragmatic. The city
                was strategically located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, making it a crucial military
                point of defense against the Ottomans on the southern Hungarian border. In addition to its defensive
                role, the river routes facilitated the development of trade and customs houses, which brought economic
                prosperity to the city and rapid development into an urban, military, and cultural metropolis.</p>
            <p>Transformation: The city was in a "destroyed and neglected" state, and the Despot immediately began a
                massive rebuilding project, constructing new fortifications, a court, churches, a library, and a
                hospital. <br>
                Cultural Hub: Under his rule, Belgrade became a significant refuge for scholars and artists fleeing
                Ottoman advances, fostering a period of cultural and literary prosperity sometimes associated with early
                signs of the Renaissance in the Serbian lands.</p>
            <p>Despot Stefan was also a remarkably educated ruler, known not only for his political skill but for his
                literary work as well. His most famous piece, "Slovo ljubve" (The Word of Love), addressed to his
                brother Vuk, reflects the refined style of late Byzantine literature. Several of his charters, including
                those issued to Hilandar Monastery, further reveal his sophisticated command of language and his
                understanding of diplomacy. Through his leadership, creativity, and cultural patronage, Stefan
                strengthened Serbia's position as an important political and cultural center in the early fifteenth
                century.
